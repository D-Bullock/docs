See also the FAQ section at `<http://discussion.oxyplot.org>`_.

Where is the source code?
-------------------------

The source code can be found at GitHub: `<https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot>`_.

Where can I find examples?
--------------------------

All solutions contain an "ExampleBrowser" project that can be used to render the examples defined in the "ExampleLibrary" project.

The example library contains platform independent code and the source can be found in `~Source\\Examples\\ExampleLibrary\\Examples <https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot/tree/develop/Source/Examples/ExampleLibrary/Examples>`_. See also the platform specific examples in the `Examples <https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot/tree/develop/Source/Examples>`_ folder.

Why are the plots not showing up in my Xamarin.Forms project?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Did you forget to add a reference to the OxyPlot platform projects and initialize the renderers? See `getting started <../getting-started/hello-xamarin-forms>`_ for more information.
