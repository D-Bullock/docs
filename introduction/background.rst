OxyPlot was started in 2010 as a simple WPF plotting component, focusing on simplicity, performance and visual appearance.

The style of the plots is inspired by the books written by Edward Tufte and Stephen Few. Their principles have been imporant when designing this component.

OxyPlot is primarily focused on two-dimensional coordinate systems, that's the reason for the 'xy' in the name!
