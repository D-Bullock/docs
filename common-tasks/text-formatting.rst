Superscript and subscript
-------------------------

Titles, axis titles and series legends can contain sub- and superscript.

Use the following notation (like Tex):

Superscript: ``x^{2}``
Subscript: ``H_{2}O``

Note: the sub- or superscript must always be enclosed in curly brackets (you cannot use ``x^2``).
