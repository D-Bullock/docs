API documentation
-----------------

The API documentation is the reference to all namespaces and types of the library. 
The documentation is provided at TODO.

The API documentation is generated from XML comments in the code. All methods and properties should be documented in compliance with the StyleCop rules. 

Namespaces are documented in `NamespaceDoc.cs` files.

The library as a whole is documented in the `LibraryDoc.cs` file. The content of this file is shown on the index page of the API documentation.


User's guide
------------

The user's guide contains "hand-written" information about how to use the library. The user's guide is provided online (html) and as a compiled help file (chm). There will also be a printable version (pdf).


Contributions
-------------

Contributions to the documentation should be done the same way as for code. Clone the `repository <https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot.github.io>`_, create a branch and submit a pull request when the changes are ready.
